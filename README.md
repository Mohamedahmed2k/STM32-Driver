# STM32-Driver
---
1. *Analog/Digital Converter (ADC) Driver*: Handles communication between analog sensors and the microcontroller, converting analog signals to digital data.

2. *Alternative Function (AF) Driver*: Manages alternate functions of GPIO pins, such as enabling UART, SPI, or I2C communication.

3. *Direct Memory Allocation (DMA) Driver*: Facilitates efficient data transfer between peripherals and memory without CPU intervention.

4. *External Interrupt Driver*: Enables interrupt handling from external events or signals.

5. *Flash Driver*: Manages read/write operations to non-volatile memory (e.g., flash memory).

6. *General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Driver*: Controls input/output pins for various purposes.

7. *UART Driver*: Handles serial communication via Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) interfaces.

8. *SPI Driver*: Manages Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication for connecting devices like sensors or displays.

9. *System Tick Driver*: Provides a system timer for scheduling tasks or managing time-related operations.

10. *Reset and Clock Control (RCC) Driver*: Configures system clocks and peripheral clocks.

11. *NVIC Driver*: Manages interrupt priorities and enables efficient handling of interrupts in a microcontroller system.
