# STM32-Driver

## Overview
The STM32-Driver repository provides a collection of drivers for various peripherals and functionalities of STM32 microcontrollers. These drivers facilitate efficient communication, data transfer, and control over different hardware components connected to the microcontroller.

## List of Drivers

1. *Analog/Digital Converter (ADC) Driver*: Handles communication between analog sensors and the microcontroller, converting analog signals to digital data.

2. *Alternative Function (AF) Driver*: Manages alternate functions of GPIO pins, enabling UART, SPI, or I2C communication, among others.

3. *Direct Memory Allocation (DMA) Driver*: Facilitates efficient data transfer between peripherals and memory without CPU intervention, enhancing system performance.

4. *External Interrupt Driver*: Enables interrupt handling from external events or signals, providing real-time responsiveness to the system.

5. *Flash Driver*: Manages read/write operations to non-volatile memory, such as flash memory, ensuring reliable storage and retrieval of data.

6. *General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Driver*: Controls input/output pins for various purposes, offering flexibility in interfacing with external devices.

7. *UART Driver*: Handles serial communication via Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) interfaces, facilitating communication with other devices.

8. *SPI Driver*: Manages Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication, allowing the microcontroller to communicate with SPI-compatible devices like sensors or displays.

9. *System Tick Driver*: Provides a system timer for scheduling tasks or managing time-related operations, essential for time-sensitive applications.

10. *Reset and Clock Control (RCC) Driver*: Configures system clocks and peripheral clocks, ensuring proper timing and synchronization within the microcontroller system.

11. *NVIC Driver*: Manages interrupt priorities and enables efficient handling of interrupts, optimizing system performance and responsiveness.
